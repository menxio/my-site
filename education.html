                    <h3>Kindergarten</h3>
                    <p>
                        I attented to schools during my kindergarten days. During kinder 1, I went to PNP
                        Ladies Club Learning Center. Then I transferred to Little Gems Learning Center.
                        I graduated there year 2007.

                    <h3>Elementary</h3>
                    <p>
                        By the time I was in elementary, I have been a part of the Malaybalay City Central
                        School Cream Class for 5 years. Unfortunately by 6th grade I didn't pass the exam
                        but still somehow went to 1st section. The cream class in our school is like a special
                        section where every kid is made competitive. Well, it was fun while it lasted. Don't
                        get me wrong, being in the regular section is really fun as well. It's like a breath of
                        fresh air. I graduated on year 2013.

                    <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>
                        I can't deny that high school holds the most enjoyable moments of my life. It's just a
                        whole different thing. I belonged in the Revised Basic Education (RBEC). At first I
                        wanted to enroll in the Special Program in Sports (SPS), but turns out that sports isn't
                        really my thing. I took up the Electronincs class as my specialty in our TLE subject because
                        I really like hardwares, computers, and technology all in all. From junior high school, 
                        moving ceremony was done year 2017, then I proceeded to senior high school at the same school.
                        There I enrolled in the TVL program, taking the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT)
                        specialization. By the 12th grade, we were assesed by TESDA for our National Certificate II (NCII)
                        in Computer System Servicing. Though I expected to learn programming at that time, but unfortunately
                        they did not offer it in the course. I received the certificate November of 2018. Yes, I am competent
                        in computer hardware and system servicing, thus, it was the reason I was able to build my own PC
                        by December 2019. I graduated high school on year 2019.

                    <h3>College</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a 3rd year irregular BSIT student at the Bukidnon State University. Supposedly, I should
                        be in my 4th year now had I not lost hope to myself. I lost my old self. The one who strived to reach
                        his goals. The one who dreamed to be a developer. It was during the pandemic when online classes and
                        flexible learning was implemented. I had a very bad academic performance. I was really lucky the University
                        offered us a second chance to redeem ourselves. As sir Klevie once said to me and I quote, "All you need is
                        more effort and perseverance. When you graduate in IT, there is more pressure in your workplace than there is in
                        studying.", and I kept that in mind. Thank you, Sir.
