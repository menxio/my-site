                <h3>My Dream Job</h3>
                <p class="goal">
                    I've always thought of what or where I should proceed after finishing college. I used to dream of creating and developing video games. Not long then, 
                    I started to gain interest in web development. I want to be a web developer since it is a 
                    fast-paced, challenging career centered on creative problem-solving and continuous innovation. 
                    Not to mention its high in demand, also because it is constantly evolving. We know that the 
                    technology industry moves quickly, and web developers are constantly learning and advancing in 
                    their careers, I see that as a fun thing to do since there is practically no limit to how much 
                    I can improve my skills and progress in my career as a web developer. And no matter what, I will
                    make it. I have to.
