              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">I am a student and an aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer.
                 I'm currently studying at the <a href="https://buksu.edu.ph" target="_blank">Bukidnon State University</a>.
                 I love coffee. ☕

                <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>I have only started learning to code since I got to college when I took the IT program in <a href="https://buksu.edu.ph" target="_blank">Bukidnon State University</a>. I have started to take
                    interest in programming back when I was in 8th grade because, first, I find being a developer a pretty cool job. Lastly, I have always loved
                    video games ever since I was a kid, and I have always dreamed of making my own video game.</p>

                <h3>Singing</h3>
                <p>I started singing when I was 6 years old because I got chosen to be the one to present an intermission during our graduation day.
                    Over time, I have made singing a hobby such as singing in karaoke's, and doing song covers.</p>

                <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
                <p>Playing guitar has been a hobby of mine since I was 12. I used to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sunghajung" target="_blank">Sungha Jung</a> on youtube back in the day so I started learning how to play it.
                    I joined the DPWH Summer Camp Rock way back 2016 as well.</p>
