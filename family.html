                <h2>Us, The Growing Tree</h2>
                <p class="family-paragraph">
                    We are nine siblings. There are two girls and seven boys, which includes me of course. 
                    I have such a big family‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that great? Well, for me it is. I am so lucky to have 
                    a family like this. I was disciplined, raised with great care and love. My father is a 
                    retired policeman and my mother being a housewife‚Ä¶. we had a little sari-sari store back 
                    in the day on our old house before we moved in to our new home and that‚Äôs what kept her 
                    busy. We‚Äôve gone through a lot of hardships as well. Life wasn‚Äôt that great back then. 
                    We experienced financial problems, and even had to loan. Thankfully all of my siblings 
                    is now working and is able to sustain on their own. I have parents who never gave up on 
                    me on times where I feel hopeless, and siblings who always cheer me up whenever I feel 
                    down. Not just them, but my in-laws as well. Without them, I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am now. 
                    They nurtured and protected me and taught me with great values and morals. And every time 
                    I needed them, they were always there. I don‚Äôt know how I cant repay them but I am going to 
                    strive hard and won‚Äôt disappoint them‚Ä¶ well, seems like I already did haha. But hey, redemption 
                    arc here I go. I have to finish my studies and make them proud.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="family-paragraph">
                    Undoubtedly we have no problems that are left unsolved. I am grateful of this family I have, 
                    this growing tree that I am part of. Praying that God will nurture this Family Tree; strengthen 
                    its roots so it will remain still whatever storm it may face; guide its branches so it may grow 
                    supporting one another; and bless this tree to be more fruitful ‚Äì its fruits to be a testament of Gods greatness.

                        I thank God for giving me the parents I have now.
                        I cannot imagine my life without them. They helped me 
                        in every step of my life, trained me, for future challenges.
                        They will always have my utmost respect. The roots of the growing
                        tree that we are now, with a love that grows and is stable.
                        As strong as a tree, we may bend in the wind but we will never break.
                        Our guiding light, and our source of protection. ü§ç
